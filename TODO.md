# UNPRIORITISED
- update .env.example file to be more user friendly
- update env variable file to be able to be external (dont mandate that its in the same folder, e.g., ../env)
- add make as a prerequisite (which is apparently not always there on ubuntu server?)
- add chmod +x as a step on setting the makefiles up
